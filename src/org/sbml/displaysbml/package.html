  This package contains parsers for MIRIAM and SBO files, helper classes for 
  LaTeX code writing and GUI layout setup, string operations, an interface
  for general conversion of SBML into some human-readable report and the actual
  converter SBML2LaTeX. The class SBMLconverter provides access to the main
  functions whereas SBML2LaTeX already requires elements defined by libSBML.
  The whole package depends on libSBML 3.3.1 or later.
