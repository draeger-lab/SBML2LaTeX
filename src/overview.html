  <h1>SBML2LaTeX</h1>
  <p>
  SBML2LaTeX is a documentation tool for models of biological processes that are
  encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML, see
  <a href="http://sbml.org">sbml.org</a> and
  <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/11/1455"
  target="_blank">SBML2LaTeX</a> for details).
  </p><p>
  This program can be used in multiple ways. The most common scenario would be
  to run it on a web server because for many users the installation of the LaTeX
  system can be tricky. If a LaTeX installation is available, a graphical user
  interface provides several options to customize the layout and information
  content of the model report to be generated by SBML2LaTeX. Another option
  would be to run SBML2LaTeX using its rich command-line interface or to embed
  it into third-party programs.
  </p><p>
  Since the application itself is very light-weight and simple, this API
  documentation is intended to help understanding how to use it and how to run
  SBML2LaTeX as a report-generator back-end in an end-user application.
  </p><p>
  Since version 1.0 SBML2LaTeX also supports the SBML Layout extension and can
  create drawings of biological networks. To this end, SBML2LaTeX interprets
  the layout description in the model so that the images look like
  <a href="http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3721/version/4">Process
  Diagrams</a> of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, see
  <a href="http://sbgn.org">sbgn.org</a>). The LaTeX package
  <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/">Ti<i>k</i>Z</a> is used to draw the
  images inside of the LaTeX document, similar as this has been implemented in
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sbml2tikz/">SBML2tikz</a>.
