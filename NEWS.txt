	       SBML2LaTeX NEWS -- History of user-visible changes

======================================================================
Version 1.0 (2011-12-16)
======================================================================

New Features:

- SBML2LaTeX is now entirely based on JSBML 0.8 and does not depend
  on libSBML anymore.

- We eliminated MIRIAM parser from the SBML2LaTeX project because the 
  new site http://identifiers.org provides the full functionality 
  online; hence no parser is needed for the MIRIAM XML file, neither 
  do we have to maintain this file up to date. Since our MIRIAM parser
  was written based on JDOM, which could now be removed from 
  SBML2LaTeX, the entire application has become much more light-weight
  and also much faster.
  
- With these two major changes SBML2LaTeX has therefore now become 
  an integrable application for other Java programs.
  
- SBML2LaTeX has now an additional set of options that allow users to
  exclude certain sections from the report. In this way, it is, for 
  instance, possible to generate only the derived ordinary differential
  equation system for a given model.
  
- SBML2LaTeX has now an online update notification.

- Localization: the user interface of SBML2LaTeX now supports German 
  in addition to English. The reports generated by the program are,
  however, in English only.
  
Bug fixes:

- The command-line interface has been revised and improved.
